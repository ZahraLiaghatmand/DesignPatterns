# Simple Code for Design Patterns

## Overview

This repository contains simple implementations of various design patterns in C#/.NET. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design and can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your code. This project serves as a reference for developers seeking to understand and apply design patterns in their own projects.

## Design Patterns Included

The following design patterns are implemented in this sample code:

1. **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating instances of several derived classes.
2. **Observer Pattern**: 
- It is used when the state of an object changes and we need to notify other objects about this changes. 
- Defines an Interface called the Observer with a method called update(). Now the other objecs (observers) that had to be notified can implement the update() method and figure out how to update themselves. also the Observable object needs the methods: AddObserver(Observer observer), RemoveObserver(Observer observer), NotifyObservers() which iterarate over the list of observers and calls the update on every observer's update() method.

- Push Style: We can push a value to the observer through the update() method, but if in the future there will be an observer that needs another set of values, you have to change the update method.

- Pull Style: This way the concrete observer is dependent on the concrete observable which is fine.

- Example: In excel if you change values of a data source the pie chart based on those values will change.
3. **Mediator Pattern**: 
- It is usefull when a bunch of objects need to talk to each other. 
- Defines an abstract class called owner with a changed(Object object) method and every object that has changed can call on this method, so every concrete object is coupled with the concrete owner that implements the changed() method.

- Example: a dialogue box with some UI Controls that should be able to talk to each other like if a textbox is not empty, the button on that dialogue box should be enabled.
